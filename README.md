# woerdl_game
cool game

The woerdl_game is a very cool game you can play. In "main" you can find the game itself. You can define the number of letters the word you want to guess
should have. Once that is defined you can have a lot of fun of guessing the right word.

If you are too lazy to guess the word on your own, you can find a solution in the branch "solution" as it is not yet automated, you have to add several
parameters manually:
- the number you letters you selected to guess
- the feedback you got once you entered the proposed word

Watch out: Don't forget to install the requierd Natural Language Toolkit. You can do that with the following command:
pip install --user -U nltk
